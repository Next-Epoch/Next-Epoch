Understanding this fact, I decided to stop being a sideline investor and use my experience as a former public health practitioner in quality improvement and as a business owner to voice governance actions and development pathway that will benefit the development of this blockchain."

However, as it becomes decentralised, active participation in ensuring that this continues to be a priority is of high importance. Though I was once a retail investor, as I continue to learn more about the development of Cardano, it became more obvious that I need to stop being a sideline investor and begin actively participating in the conversation for the future."
